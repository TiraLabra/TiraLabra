The DLR station opened, with the Beckton Branch, on 28 March 1994. There was a previous station on the same site, called Poplar station, which was served by the London and Blackwall Railway from 6 July 1840 to 3 May 1926. Blackwall station on the London and Blackwall Railway was actually further east.
