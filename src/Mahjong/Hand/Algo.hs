                -- ^ Note that jantou (the pair) are viewed as koutsu
                -- waits. It's pretty logical when you think about it.

-- | `tilesGroupL` simply returns all possible groupings for the tiles
--
-- The algorithm goes through the input list of tiles (after sorting it)
-- trying to use the first tile (head of the list) to form:
--
--  1. an ankan
--  2. an ankou
--  3. an ankou wait
--  4. a shuntsu
--  5. a shuntsu wait with its successor
--  6. a shuntsu wait the successor's successor (middle wait), or
--  7. discard the tile as a `GroupLeftOver`.
--
-- Whenever any of these are possible, the result is cons'ed to every
-- result from applying the function recurively on the remaining tiles.
-- The end result is a list of all possible groups.
--
-- = Performance concerns and optimizations
--
-- Complete mentsu are always preferred over incomplete (and incomplete
-- over leftovers) and are placed at the head of the list /on that level of
-- recursion/.  However, there is no guarentee that minimal groupings
-- couldn't reside in the result's tail.

-- * Calculating shanten

--
-- /Technical details./ Even though the subtract algorithm gives -1 for all
-- complete hands, not all -1 indicate a complete hand. Consider for
-- example a hand with 4x complete melds and tiles of a shuntsu wait: the
-- algorithm thinks this is a complete hand when in fact the pair is
-- missing. Therefore we check the condition that the pair is there and
-- then return @(Just -1)@. In the case of an invalid complete hand we
-- return `Nothing`.
