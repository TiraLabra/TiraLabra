Thousands support online campaign to eat and drink Finnish-made products

"Eat and drink Finnish", a campaign initiated by National Coalition Party MPs Heikki Autto, Timo Heinonen and Jaana Pelkonen to encourage Finns to eat and drink only foodstuff originating in Finland has garnered thousands of social media supporters in just a few days. Countersanctions from Russia limiting exports from EU countries are behind the motion.

By 5.00 pm on Sunday August 10, the Facebook page for the campaign encouraging Finns to eat and drink Finnish-made products and support Finnish food suppliers in difficult times had gathered over 21,500 likes.

The campaign began last Friday and was launched by the National Coalition Party MPs Heikki Autto, Timo Heinonen and Jaana Pelkonen.

They say the campaign is intended to draw attention to the problems facing the Finnish food sector. Russian countersanctions banning the import of meat, fish, dairy products and fruits and vegetables from the US, EU, Norway, Canada and Australia are the impetus.  

“We have calculated that if everyone would spend just 10 euros more each month on domestic food, we could create 10,000 new jobs in the foodstuffs sector. This also works to secure Finnish jobs in the food industry,” the MPs said in a bulletin released on Saturday.

Russia’s recent moves have also provoked resistance in other areas, including Poland. Starting in early August, a wave of Poles posted photos of themselves biting into apples on Twitter and Instagram to annoy Russian President Vladimir Putin. The phenomenon began after Russia announced an import ban on Polish fruit.
