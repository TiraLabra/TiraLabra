A Day in the Life of…

Some of you may have already noticed that we have a new Community team. In addition to running our Support, we try to be active in the Steam Community, and some other places as well. :) As a part of this, we wanted to start a new blog series called “A Day in the Life of…” – the purpose of which is to introduce us and other people here at the Frozenbyte office, and perhaps offer you kind of a sneak peak into what life is like here.

During the next several months we’ll be going through the many different departments here and write blog posts about each one. Before each post, you will be given a chance to ask questions from the department in turn next. We’ll then go poke around the office, do an interview using some of your questions, and then publish a blog post with the interview and probably some other stuff as well. We’ll add some pictures, of course!

We will try to keep this blog series running in sort of a regular basis, but we won’t make any definite promises about the schedule; longer delays may occur when we are really busy.

The first department we’ll be covering is our Quality Assurance team (QA). QA is very important for us, and we actually do all of our game testing ourselves, as opposed to outsourcing it. At the moment, QA is one of our largest teams. Post your questions to our QA team in the comments below!

We’ll give you a while to post questions before starting to work on on the interview. Keep in mind though that we might not be able to answer all questions, especially if they are about secret stuff. ;)

Cheers all,
Marjut & Riikka
Frozenbyte Community Team
