Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Moves to March 25, 2016!

Justice is set to dawn nearly two months earlier than originally planned! Warner Bros. Pictures has moved the release of their highly-anticipated superhero team-up Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to March 25, 2016! The original date of May 6, 2016 had the film opening opposite Marvel Studios' Captain America 3. It will now go up against Brett Ratner's Beverly Hills Cop, while Dean Devlin's Geostorm, originally set for that date, has been moved to an unspecified 2016 release.

The Zack Snyder-directed action adventure stars Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter and Scoot McNairy.

UPDATE: Warner Bros. Pictures has now mapped out a massive schedule of DC Comics properties! The mystery DC Comics films are set for release on:

- August 5, 2016
- June 23, 2017
- November 17, 2017
- March 23, 2018 
- July 27, 2018 
- April 5, 2019 
- June 14, 2019 
- April 3, 2020
