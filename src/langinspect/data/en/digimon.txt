The Digimon Adventure 15th Anniversary Event announced on Friday that the characters of the first Digimon Adventure anime are returning next spring. The video shown at the end of the event described the main character Taichi as being 17 years old in high school with his Digimon partner Agumon. The sequel anime series will tell a "new story" "for all the 'DigiDestined' in the world." "Now, [once] again, the adventure evolves." A pamphlet at the event confirmed that the project is a new animation series in production.


The first Digimon Adventure television anime series premiered in 1999 and followed the adventures of several children in the Digital World.

The first copies of the box will include a new special drama CD on March 3, 2015. The Digimon the Movies Blu-ray 1998-2006 box will ship on January 9, 2015. This box will include a bonus Blu-ray 3D disc with the 3D film shorts Digimon Adventure: Digimon Grand Prix! by Mamoru Hosoda and Digimon Savers: Digital World Kiki Ippatsu! by Tetsuji Nakamura.
