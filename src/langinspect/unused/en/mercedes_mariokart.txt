Nintendo Adds Three Mercedes-Benz Cars to Mario Kart 8

Nintendo has announced that on August 27, players can download three free Mercedes-Benz cars for Mario Kart 8, including the modern Mercedes-Benz GLA, the 300 SL Roadster from the 1950s and the legendary Silver Arrow of the 1930s.

The GLA model comes with special wheel options, while players can customize all three new karts with various wheels and gliders in the game. The new content arrives on the 22nd anniversary of the launch of the original "Mario Kart" game, Super Mario Kart, which first launched in Japan on Aug. 27, 1992.

All competitors need is a Wii U console, Mario Kart 8 game, a broadband Internet connection and the Mercedes-Benz karts. Access to the "Mercedes Cup" in the game can be found in the online tournament section.
