The file generator.cpp must be compiled. After running it, 2 types of tests will be generated:
- single query test files which will have the following format

input:
[number of tests]
[haystack1]
[needle1]
...
[haystackN]
[needleN]

which means that needle1 will be the substring we are searching for in haystack1.

output:
[ans1]
[ans2]
...
[ansN]

where [ans1] is equal to the index where needle1 is found in haystack1. If it is not found, then [ans1] will have value -1.

- multiple query tests:

input:
[number of tests]
[haystack1]
[needle1]
...
[haystackN]
[needleN]

output:
[number of positions] [pos1] [pos2] ... [posN]
...
[number of positions] [pos1] [pos2] ... [posN]

where N=[number of positions] means that needle1 has been found N times in haystack1. Note that if N=0 then the needle has not been found
in the haystack.
