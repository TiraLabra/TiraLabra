/*
PLEASE NOTE

At this point there is no point to measure performance as the rendering doesn't work yet so it only draws blue (:D this will change very soon though, since the algorithm implementation is technically finished, except some debugging is needed)
In theory you could test how long it takes for the program to start, but that's not the point of the project.
Performance tests can be made when we actually get stuff drawn and we can compare differences in the FPS achieved.

Other types of testing is done at run-time.
